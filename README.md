## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a student will complete a course using learning and engagement data. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to identify patterns that influence student completion behavior.

## Business Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts student course completion based on demographic and engagement-related features.

## Approach
- Performed data preprocessing to handle missing values and improve data quality.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and relationships in the data.
- Applied feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
- Trained and evaluated multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Compared model performance to select the most effective approach.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Classification, Model Evaluation  

## Key Learnings
- Gained experience working with large datasets and performing structured data analysis.
- Improved understanding of feature selection and model evaluation techniques.
- Developed practical skills in applying machine learning to real-world educational data problems.
